# Dotfiles

## What is it?

This is my dotfiles including Neovim, tmux, CoC.

It contains all the plugins I personally use, vim plugin manager (I use vim-plug), and some key mappings

You can use it for your own development environment but you might wanna have an understanding of what it does before using it

Those are the resources I used back then when I constructed my neovim config:

## Contributing

Feel free to send a PR if you'd like to make changes, maybe comment on some settings that I skipped, add instructions to this README or fix something, whatever you see fit :)
