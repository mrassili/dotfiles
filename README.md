# nvim-config

This is my Neovim config (init.vim, coc settingsâ€¦)

It contains all the plugins I personally use, vim plugin manager, and some key mappings

You can use it for your own development environment but you might wanna have an understanding of what it does before using it

#### Those are the resources I used back then when I constructed my neovim config:

- https://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html
- https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc
- https://github.com/glnds/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc
- https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Script:Best_plugins_selected_by_the_IRC_community

#### Contributing

Feel free to send a PR if you'd like to make changes, maybe comment on some settings that I skipped, or fix something, whatever you see fit :)
